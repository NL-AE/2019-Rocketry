# 2019 Rocketry

Rocket for entry into the 2019 UKRoC challenge with 5 other friends.


Launch day: we put 4 motors instead of 3 and the rocket flew some 380m (about 120m over target). We lost the bottom stage so we now have half a rocket. 

In retrospective, painting it camouflage green was also not a good idea considering it landed in a green field.
Also I made the arduino write to the "DATALOG.TXT" instead of the file in the SD card called "data.txt" so we didnt get any data.

The control system looked like it worked since the rocket didnt have a rapid unplanned disassembly and shot straight upwards.
